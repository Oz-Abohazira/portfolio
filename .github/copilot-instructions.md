# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This is a code-driven narrative portfolio built with React and Next.js. The portfolio presents the developer's journey as an interactive debugging experience where visitors explore projects through terminal-like commands.

## Development Approach
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Always provide detailed explanations for code implementations
- **Reasoning Documentation**: Explain WHY certain decisions are made, not just WHAT is being done
- **Educational Focus**: Break down complex concepts into understandable parts
- **Best Practices**: Highlight React/Next.js best practices and patterns as they're implemented

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement TypeScript for better type safety (when applicable)
- Follow Next.js conventions for file structure and routing
- Use modern React patterns (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- Maintain clean, readable code with proper commenting

## Explanation Requirements
When implementing features, always explain:
1. **Purpose**: What this code accomplishes
2. **Structure**: How the component/function is organized
3. **React Patterns**: Which React concepts are being used and why
4. **Next.js Features**: How Next.js specific features enhance the solution
5. **Future Extensibility**: How the code supports adding new projects/features

## Project Structure Philosophy
- **Modular Design**: Each project should be easily addable without major refactoring
- **Component Reusability**: Build components that can be reused across different projects
- **Data-Driven**: Use configuration objects to define projects and navigation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, then add advanced features
